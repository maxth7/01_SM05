In this project, an application is used to provide the educational process<br>
with testing and teaching materials.<br>
The PostgreSQL database is used for data storage.<br>
All data (tests, manuals, and help) is in HTML format.<br>
The scientific material assumes a layout by topic,<br>
each topic should be presented with methodological materials and a test. <br>
The project aims to use all the features of the HTML format implemented in QTexBrowser<br>
(displaying text, graphics, sound, and instructional videos),<br>
so the project is limited to using the standard QTexBrowser widget.<br>
The project is not completed.<br>
The Project Help provides a description of all the functions for the Smile training program,<br>
created earlier in Delphi and used in the educational process more than 10 years ago.<br>
Some of these functions are implemented in iSmile in QT C++, available for review in DEMO_VIDEO.mp4.<br>
The static code analysis tool Clang-Tidy and Clazy did not output diagnostic messages for this project.
